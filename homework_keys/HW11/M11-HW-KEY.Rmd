# Instructions

In your **private course repo** use this notebook to write code that
performs the tasks below.

Save your notebook in the `M11` directory.

Remember to add and commit these files to your repo.

Then push your commits to your repo on GitHib.

Be sure to fill out the **Student Info** block above.

To submit your homework, save your results as a PDF and upload it to
GradeScope.

**TOTAL POINTS: 7**

# Overview

In this homework, you will work with [the Abalone
dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository.

To get started, download and import the `abalone.data` dataset from this
URL:

-   <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data>

You can pass the URL directly to `read.csv()` and that there is no
header row.

Note: The instruction to print in the questions below can be
accomplished either through the `print()` function or by displaying a
value directly.

**TOTAL POINTS: 7**

# Tasks

## Task 0

(0 points)

Get the dataset.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

uci_data <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"
df <- read.csv(uci_data, header = F)
```

## Task 1

(1 point)

Print the number of rows in the dataset.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
n_rows <- dim(df)[1]
n_rows
```

## Task 2

(1 point)

The rightmost column is the number of rings. Print the maximum number of
rings

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

This assumes you don't know that name of the column:

```{r}
max(df[length(df)])
```

This assumes you do know the name of the column:

```{r}
max(df$V9)
```

## Task 3

(1 point)

The leftmost column is the gender with these values: `M`: male, `F`:
female, `I`: infant.

Apply the `filter()` function from tidyverse to select only rows where
gender is infant, and print the number of records.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

**Method 1**

```{r}
infant_rows <- df %>% filter(V1 == 'I') 
dim(infant_rows)[1]
```

**Method 2**

```{r}
df %>%
    filter(V1 == 'I') %>%
    count() %>%
    unlist()
```

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(V1 == 'I') %>%
  summarise(count(.)) %>%
  select(n) %>%
  unlist()
```
```{r}
# Without Dplyr
count(df[df$V1 == 'I', ])$n
```

## Task 4

(1 point)

Apply the `filter()` function from `tidyverse` to select only rows where
gender is infant or male, and print the number of records.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
df %>%
    filter(V1 == 'M' | V1 == 'I') %>%
    count() %>%
    unlist()
```

## Task 5

(1 point)

Call the `table()` function on the abalone genders to find out how many
of each gender are present.

Print the result.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
table(df$V1)
```

## Task 6

(1 point)

Compute the mean value of column 2 (V2) grouped by gender.

V2 is the longest shell measurement.

Requirements: use the `%>%` operator to chain commands, and the
`group_by()` and `summarize()` functions.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
df %>% 
    group_by(V1) %>%
    summarize(V2_mean = mean(V2, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")
```

# Task 7

(1 point)

Compute the MEDIAN value of longest shell measurement for only the
males.

Requirements: use the `%>%` operator to chain commands.

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

```{r}
head(df)
```

```{r}
shell_col <- 'V2'
```

```{r}
df %>%
    filter(V1 == 'M') %>%    
    group_by(V1) %>%
    summarize(V2_median = median(V2, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
    select(V2_median)
```
