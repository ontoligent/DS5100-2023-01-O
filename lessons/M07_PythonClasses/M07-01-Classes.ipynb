    "\n",
    "When we work with things and reason about them, we generally think about their attributes, and what they can do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For similar things, it can be helpful for group them into `objects` such as cars, homes, databases, or logistic regression models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A `class` provides **a template** for creating an object, and for working with the object.\n",
    "For the case of the logistic regression model, it has `attributes` like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- weights\n",
    "- an optional intercept term\n",
    "- the maximum number of iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "These **attributes** help describe the object (they give the object's **state**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model has functionality such as:\n",
    "- the optimization routine used in training\n",
    "- a prediction function\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior, or functionality, is supported by **methods**, which are functions included in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **tremendous benefits to programming with objects**, or object-oriented programming (OOP), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects are **natural** ways of defining, grouping, communicating, and thinking about things\n",
    "- Objects are convenient for **packaging together the data and functionality**. It concisely says: what is in this thing, and what does it do?\n",
    "- It is simple to create as **many copies** of the object as you'd like\n",
    "- For more complex objects, they can take on all the attributes and methods of the simpler object. this is called `inheritance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's look at examples, starting with a very small, simple class.  \n",
    "The class contains:\n",
    "- a name (Ferrari458)\n",
    "- a docstring for a quick description\n",
    "- an attribute, which is number of cylinders in the engine\n",
    "- a method"
